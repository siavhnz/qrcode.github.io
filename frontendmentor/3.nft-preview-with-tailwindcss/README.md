## My process

### Workflow

 - mobile-first design
 - Desktop design
 - Compelete README.md file
 - Push solution on github.com
 - Publish solution on github.io and frontendmentor.io


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
  - main, article, figure, footer, address
- Tailwindcss

### What I learned

This is a Tailwindcss solution version for the [NFT preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U)

I learned how to:

 - [Customize default font](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family#customizing-the-default-font) to [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)

 - [Customize defaut theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color#customizing-your-theme)

> Built on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), Preflight is a set of base styles for Tailwind projects that are designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system.


### Continued development

I want to read more about pure CSS, understand its various concepts, and also; work with Tailwindcss on further challenges.

### Useful resources
